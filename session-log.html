            <h2>Session 0 - Into the Barrowlands</h2>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> February 14, 2026<br>
            <strong>Session Type:</strong> Character Creation & Campaign Setup</p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Three desperate souls, each fleeing their past and seeking something in the darkness, begin separate journeys toward the Silent Isle. At its heart lies the Barrowlands, a mausoleum continent of endless tombs and forgotten gods.</p>
            
            <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">The Travelers</h3>
            
            <p><strong>Abbot Adrian Amos Amadeus</strong>, a fervent priest of Dorvos, departed from a rekindled abbey in Aurelion. His sacred lantern never falters, but his faith has been tested by loss. He seeks to restore his order by recovering the teachings and artifacts scattered when the abbey fell to plunder. A map in his possession claims to show "the lowest place," though whether it can be trusted remains to be seen.</p>
            
            <p>To reach the Silent Isle, Adrian secured work with a salvage company. Their ship now carries him south from Aurelion's abandoned shores.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Doormirror</strong>, a scholar from Aurelion, travels on the same vessel. Thin and careful, they hide a terrible secret beneath threadbare robes: the corruption has already begun. Too Many Eyes watch from within, and Doormirror seeks knowledge in the Barrowlands that might explain, control, or perhaps accelerate their transformation. The salvage company hired them for their expertise in alchemy and ancient texts, unaware of what changes are already taking root.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Ruth</strong>, a grumpy seer from the mountain village of Sioff in the Free Kingdoms, has always heard the dead. Raised among witches and outcasts, she fled north seeking a grail rumored to grant resources to those desperate enough to find it. Instead, she found something far more dangerous: Marko's mummified head, a relic that speaks prophecy and binds itself to those who carry it.</p>
            
            <p>Now Ruth hears two choruses: the restless dead and the voice of Marko, self-proclaimed prince of noble rot. She stowed away on a ship bound for the Silent Isle's southern coast, seeking distance from her old life and some measure of understanding of the burden she now bears.</p>
            
            <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Two Ships, One Destination</h3>
            
            <p>From the north, the salvage company's ship carries Adrian and Doormirror toward a port on the Silent Isle's northern coast. The crew is professional but uneasy. They know what waits in the interior.</p>
            
            <p>From the south, Ruth hides among cargo on a vessel bound for the island's opposite shore. The crew does not know she is there. They will not welcome her discovery.</p>
            
            <p>Both ships sail toward the same cursed land. Between the two coasts lies the Barrowlands: collapsed tombs, blighted air, and something ancient stirring in the deepest dark.</p>
            
            <p>At the edge of the outer mausoleum, Captain Vess's salvage camp struggles to survive. Five of their people were dragged into the tombs by bandits days ago. Coin is offered to anyone willing to venture into the darkness and bring them back.</p>
            
            <p>The Barrowlands do not care why travelers come. They only care what they take.</p>
            
            <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">What Comes Next</h3>
            
            <p>In the next session, Adrian and Doormirror will make landfall at the northern port and begin their journey overland toward the interior. Ruth will emerge from hiding on the southern coast and navigate her own path through the blighted landscape. The journey will be perilous, and the Silent Isle does not welcome visitors.</p>
            
            <p>All three paths converge at the same destination: the Company Camp, where desperate salvagers wait at the threshold of the tombs.</p>
