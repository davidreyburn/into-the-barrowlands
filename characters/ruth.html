            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Ruth comes from a small village, Sioff, at the base of a foggy mountain, a community of witches and seers who are mostly isolated and shunned by the other factions in the South. She was raised by women who were sometimes consulted by people outside the town who had issues with the restless dead (curses and the like) and who wanted visions to help them win battles (sadly the visions rarely looked favorable).</p>
            
            <p>Growing up, a lot of people came over from the province of Rehgurd which suffered many losses and battles on its own soil, to Sioff to gain the help of the witches and seers. This was often complicated, for those other Southerners brought their curses with them, did not often have payment for services, and were quick to blame the people of Sioff if the witchy help didn't meet their needs.</p>
            
            <p>Thus Ruth grew up around a lot of conflict, though not huge battles. Often, curses carried into Sioff would start fires or sicknesses that needed to be ameliorated. Ruth has ptsd-like behaviors like being easily spooked, and has obsessive thoughts about details she wants to control.</p>
            
            <p>Ruth has always talked to the dead, and they are rarely content. She has learned to grumpily bear their presence, ignore them, swear at them, and sometimes ask them for favors and do favors for them.</p>
            
            <p>She got fed up with life in Sioff and set off into the mountains after hearing that there may be a grail that could grant the seeker with resources. Instead, she found Markkon's head.</p>
            
            <p>Markkon is an annoyance to her, because between hearing him and hearing the dead, she never gets any peace. But she is learning a lot. If only she could get a handle on the mental and emotional toll of seeing (imperfectly - fuzzy timelines) things that have not passed.</p>
