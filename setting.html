            <p class="flavor">The foundation of the tale—the world in which our story unfolds.</p>

            <h2>The World</h2>
            
            <p>This campaign takes place in a land split between two empires:</p>

            <h3>Aurelion (The Northern Empire)</h3>
            <p>Once brutal and mighty, united under the sun god Dorvos. Nearly a generation ago, they clashed with the south in a terrible war. Both empires fell into decline. When the war ended, Dorvos disappeared from the lives of his people—the sun god turned his face away. Their religion collapsed. What remains is a people haunted by silence where there was once divine light.</p>

            <h3>The Free Kingdoms (The South)</h3>
            <p>An uneasy alliance of smaller kingdoms and peoples, bound together by necessity rather than unity. The war weakened them, and now they face famine, drought, and uncertainty. Old tensions simmer beneath the surface. The alliance holds—barely. They call themselves "free" in defiance of Aurelion's former dominance.</p>

            <h3>The Silent Isle (Between the Empires)</h3>
            <p>An island lies between north and south, the site of one of the final battles of the war. Both sides suffered terrible losses there. No one who survived wanted to discuss the details. The ground is cursed by memory and blood. It is called "Silent" not for lack of sound, but because no one will speak of what happened there.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="menu-box">
            <h2>The Setup</h2>
            
            <p>Near the site of the battle stands the <strong>Barrowlands</strong>—an ancient mausoleum complex, nearly destroyed by age and war alike. It predates both Aurelion and the Free Kingdoms. Rumors speak of treasure from an ancient kingdom, something more valuable than the mere salvages of war.</p>

            <p>Privateers have begun mounting expeditions to the Silent Isle. They come for wealth, weaponry, and whatever else can be pulled from the ruins.</p>

            <p><strong>You are a new recruit in the company of one such privateer.</strong></p>

            <p>Reconstruction and salvage efforts at the Barrowlands have slowed. Then stopped. Several company men—including the site foreman—have been captured and dragged into the depths beneath the mausoleum.</p>

            <p>You are miles from home. Weak from the journey. It is your first day on the job. And yet, it has come down to you and your fellow recruits to investigate the Barrowlands and save them.</p>

            <h2>Core Truths</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The war broke both empires.</strong> Neither side won. Both sides lost something they cannot reclaim.</li>
                <li><strong>Dorvos is silent.</strong> The sun god has not spoken since the war ended. The faithful do not know if he abandoned them, or if he is dead.</li>
                <li><strong>The Silent Isle remembers.</strong> The site of the final battle is cursed ground. The dead do not rest easy there.</li>
                <li><strong>The Barrowlands are older than the war.</strong> Whatever lies beneath predates both Aurelion and the Free Kingdoms. The battle merely cracked it open.</li>
                <li><strong>No one speaks of what happened in the final battle.</strong> Those who were there carry the memory like a wound. They will not share it.</li>
                <li><strong>Famine and drought grip the Free Kingdoms.</strong> The alliance holds together out of desperation, not loyalty.</li>
                <li><strong>Privateers are desperate.</strong> The expeditions to the Silent Isle are dangerous, poorly funded, and staffed by those with nowhere else to go.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Tone & Themes</h2>
            
            <h3>Tone</h3>
            <p class="flavor">Dark, visceral, and grounded. This is not high fantasy—it is the aftermath. Empires in decline, gods gone silent, and desperate people clawing at the ruins for scraps. The Barrowlands are a wound in the world, and you are descending into it.</p>

            <h3>Themes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Loss and decline.</strong> What happens when empires fall and gods abandon their people?</li>
                <li><strong>Desperation.</strong> Why do people risk their lives for treasure in a cursed place?</li>
                <li><strong>The weight of the past.</strong> The war, the battle, the ancient kingdom—how does history shape the present?</li>
                <li><strong>What lies beneath.</strong> The Barrowlands hold secrets. Some treasures are not meant to be found.</li>
            </ul>
