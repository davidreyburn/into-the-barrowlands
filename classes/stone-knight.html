            <h1>The Stone Knight</h1>
            <p class="flavor">You were born in the deep mines where the air is poison and the dark is absolute. You learned to carry weight that would crush others, breathe fumes that would kill, and stand unmoved when fear comes crawling. Your pickaxe has tasted stone and bone alike. When the depths try to break you, you simply endure.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #d4b896;">Class Mechanics: Stone Blood</h2>
            <p>Years in the deep mines have changed you. <strong>You are immune to poison and disease</strong>—the toxic fumes and cursed minerals that kill others merely flow through your veins like water.</p>
            <p><strong>You are unmovable when you choose to be.</strong> Plant your feet, and nothing short of supernatural force can shift you. You carry burdens that would break others, stand in places that would crush lesser warriors.</p>
            <p>But the stone in your blood comes with a price: <strong>you heal slowly</strong> when resting naturally. Your body is dense, unyielding, resistant to both harm and recovery. Magical healing works normally, but time alone mends your wounds with the patience of mountains.</p>
            <p>You endure. That is what you do. That is what you are.</p>

            <p>You start with these moves:</p>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Stone-Born</h3>
                <p>You were forged in the deep places. You have an uncanny tolerance for toxins and poisons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Resist natural poisons entirely</li>
                    <li>When you Defy Danger against magical or alchemical toxins, take +1</li>
                    <li>You can breathe thin air and endure noxious fumes that would choke others</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Bearer of Burdens</h3>
                <p>Your Load is 12+STR instead of the normal calculation.</p>
                <p>You can carry immense weight without slowing. When others would be crushed or exhausted by a load, you simply endure.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Stoic Resolve</h3>
                <p>Fear and supernatural dread do not touch you easily.</p>
                <p>When you would Defy Danger against fear, terror, or mind-affecting magic from creatures of darkness, roll+CON instead of +WIS.</p>
                <p>On a 10+, you are utterly unmoved and gain +1 forward against the source of the fear.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">

                <h3>Pickaxe Mastery</h3>
                <p>Your miner's pickaxe (<em>close</em>, <em>forceful</em>, 2 weight) is a weapon of war in your hands. It deals your class damage and can puncture armor: when you Hack and Slash with it, on a 10+ you may choose to ignore 2 armor instead of dealing damage.</p>
