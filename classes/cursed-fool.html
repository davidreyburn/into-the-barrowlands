            <h1>The Cursed Fool</h1>
            <p class="flavor">The Whisper found you, or you found it, you're not sure anymore. It's a fragment of an ancient statue, worn smooth by desperate hands. It speaks truths, temptations, sins. It knows what you want most in the world. It will help you get it. And when you've marked your tenth sin against your soul, it will take you. Until then, you listen.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #d4b896;">Class Mechanics: The Whisper & Corruption</h2>
            <p>You bear <strong>The Whisper</strong>, a cursed relic that speaks secrets, lies, and half-truths. It offers power and knowledge, but feeds on your sanity and pushes you toward darkness. You never know when it speaks truth.</p>
            <p>You begin with <strong>Corruption 0</strong>. As The Whisper grants you power or you heed its counsel, mark Corruption. The relic knows what you desire most, and it will help you achieve it, at a price.</p>
            <p><strong>At 10 Corruption, The Whisper claims you.</strong> Your soul becomes forfeit, and you are lost to its will. The line between your voice and its voice has already begun to blur.</p>
            <p>Every sin, every dark bargain, every moment you trust the lies, these bring you closer to the end. The Whisper promises it will be worth it.</p>

            <h2>Starting Moves</h2>
            <p>You start with these moves:</p>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>The Whisper</h3>
                <p>You possess The Whisper, a fragment of an ancient statue, worn smooth by desperate hands. It speaks only to you, revealing truths, temptations, and the sins of those nearby.</p>
                <p>The Whisper is bound to you. It cannot be removed willingly, and if separated, it will find its way back. It weighs nothing and marks you as different, those who see it know something is wrong.</p>
                <p>When you <strong>consult The Whisper about someone's desires, secrets, or sins</strong>, roll+WIS. ✴On a 10+, The Whisper reveals a useful truth; ask the GM one question about the target. ✴On a 7-9, it whispers truth mixed with poison; learn something useful but The Whisper plants doubt or paranoia in your mind.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Smooth Gauntlet</h3>
                <p>Your other hand bears a stone gauntlet, ancient and seamless. It magnifies your strength grotesquely.</p>
                <p>When you wear the gauntlet, gain +1 to Hack and Slash. On a 10+ with Hack and Slash while wearing it, you may choose to deal +1d6 damage and mark 1 Corruption.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Deepest Desire</h3>
                <p>The Whisper knows what you want. At character creation, name your deepest desire (revenge, power, redemption, knowledge, etc.).</p>
                <p>When you act directly toward this desire, take +1 forward. But when you stray from it or are tempted away, The Whisper will remind you, loudly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Marked by the Stone</h3>
                <p>Others can sense something wrong with you. When you Parley, take -1 unless you hide The Whisper and the gauntlet. Those who know what you are may fear or pity you.</p>
                <p>However, you can always tell when someone else bears a curse, relic, or unnatural burden.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Corruption</h3>
                <p>You begin with 0 Corruption. When you use the stone's power (via certain moves or choices), you mark Corruption.</p>
                <p><strong>At 3 Corruption:</strong> The Whisper becomes louder. It speaks unbidden. Take -1 to Discern Realities as it clouds your mind with its voice.</p>
                <p><strong>At 6 Corruption:</strong> The stone begins to spread. Your gauntleted arm hardens, becomes stiff. You cannot remove armor or gloves from that arm.</p>
                <p><strong>At 10 Corruption:</strong> You are no longer yourself. The GM will tell you what The Whisper wants, and you must pursue it. Create a new character.</p>
                <p>You may reduce Corruption by 1 when you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Confess your sins to someone who forgives you</li>
                    <li>Reject The Whisper's guidance at great personal cost</li>
                    <li>Ritually cleanse yourself in a place of sanctity (holy site, pure spring, etc.)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

            <p>Help someone achieve their desire, knowing it will cost them.</p>
            <p><strong>Evil</strong></p>
            <p>Use The Whisper's knowledge to manipulate or destroy someone.</p>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Stone's Counsel</h3>
                <p>When you <strong>ask The Whisper for advice about achieving your Deepest Desire</strong>, roll+WIS. ✴On a 10+, it offers a clear, actionable path; take +1 ongoing while following it. ✴On a 7-9, it offers a path, but following it will cost you something (a relationship, your morals, your safety).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Iron Will</h3>
                <p>You have learned to resist The Whisper's pull. When you would mark Corruption, roll+WIS. ✴On a 10+, do not mark Corruption. ✴On a 7-9, mark it, but The Whisper falls silent for a while, you have its attention.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Whispered Secrets</h3>
                <p>The Whisper can hear the sins of those nearby. When you <strong>focus on someone you can see</strong>, roll+WIS. ✴On a 10+, The Whisper tells you their greatest shame or secret. ✴On a 7-9, it tells you something, but it's cryptic or incomplete.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Gauntlet's Fury</h3>

            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Polished by Fools</h3>
                <p>You understand the nature of curses and relics. When you examine a cursed or enchanted object, you can ask the GM one question about it and they will answer honestly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Burden Shared</h3>
                <p>When you reveal your curse to someone and they accept you anyway, gain +1 Bond with them immediately.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="menu-box">
            <h2>Advanced Moves</h2>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>The Stone Spreads</h3>
                <p>You have accepted the curse. Your non-gauntleted arm can also become stone at will. When you do:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gain +2 armor on that side</li>
                    <li>Your unarmed strikes deal d8 damage and have the <em>forceful</em> tag</li>
                    <li>Mark 1 Corruption when you invoke this</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The stone recedes when you will it, but each time it spreads a little further.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Whisper's Dominion</h3>
                <p>The Whisper can now speak to others through you. When you <strong>channel its voice to command or terrify</strong>, roll+CHA. ✴On a 10+, they obey or flee; choose one to mark Corruption or let them act. ✴On a 7-9, they hesitate, and you mark 1 Corruption regardless.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Unbreakable</h3>
                <p>Your bond with The Whisper has made you resilient to outside influence. You are immune to charm, mind control, and possession. The Whisper will not share you.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Sins Made Manifest</h3>
                <p>When you <strong>speak aloud someone's secret sin</strong> (learned via The Whisper), roll+CHA. ✴On a 10+, they are shaken, paralyzed by shame; they cannot act against you this scene. ✴On a 7-9, they are rattled but recover quickly; they know you've seen into them.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>The Fool's Bargain</h3>
                <p>Once per session, you may ask The Whisper to grant you exactly what you need in this moment (a weapon, knowledge, an ally's arrival, an enemy's mistake).</p>
                <p>The GM will make it happen. Then, mark 3 Corruption. The stone always takes its due.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Purge the Stone</h3>
                <p>Once, you may reduce your Corruption to 0. Describe the monumental act of will, sacrifice, or redemption required. If you ever reach 10 Corruption again after this, you cannot use this move, you get one chance.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Whisper's Price</h3>
                <p>When you reach 10 Corruption and would become lost, you may instead make The Whisper an offer: serve it willingly for one year and one day, and it will spare you.</p>
                <p>If you accept, reset Corruption to 0 but take -1 ongoing to resist The Whisper's commands. At the end of the year, the GM will tell you what you've become.</p>
                <p><em>The Whisper knows what you want. It will help you. And when you've marked your tenth sin, it will take you.</em></p>
