            <h1>The Sun Priest</h1>
            <p class="flavor">The sun god Dorvos turned his face away after the northern empire fell. You carry his cinder—an ever-burning coal of holy wood locked in iron—and you walk toward the lowest place in the world. If you can bring light to where it has never touched, maybe he'll come back. Maybe.</p>
