            <h1>The Sun Priest</h1>
            <p class="flavor">The sun god Dorvos turned his face away after the northern empire fell. You carry his cinder—an ever-burning coal of holy wood locked in iron—and you walk toward the lowest place in the world. If you can bring light to where it has never touched, maybe he'll come back. Maybe.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #d4b896;">Class Mechanics: The Pilgrimage & The Sacrifice</h2>
            <p>You carry the Lantern of Dorvos on a sacred journey tracked by your <strong>Pilgrimage</strong> progress (1-10). The lantern must never leave your possession—lose 1 Progress per turn without it.</p>
            <p><strong>If you end a session without the lantern</strong> (lost or extinguished), you must complete <strong>The Sacrifice</strong> before the next session ends or suffer Involuntary Immolation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Burn an innocent alive in the lantern's flame</li>
                <li>Immolate a willing or helpless ally</li>
                <li>Sacrifice one of your own limbs to the fire</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Failure to sacrifice means death by holy fire from within. This is the price of bearing Dorvos's light.</p>

            <h2>Starting Moves</h2>
            <p>You start with these moves:</p>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>The Sacred Lantern</h3>
                <p>You bear the Lantern of Dorvos: an iron lantern on a heavy chain, housing an ever-burning cinder of holy wood. It weighs 1, has the <em>close</em> and <em>forceful</em> tags, and you may use STR or WIS when you Hack and Slash with it.</p>
                <p>The lantern provides light (near range) and never goes out unless extinguished by powerful magic or divine curse.</p>
                <p><strong>All your priestly moves channel through the lantern.</strong> Without it, you cannot use Radiant Healing, Holy Fire, or Turn the Darkness.</p>
                <p><strong>The iron contains Dorvos's presence.</strong> Without the lantern, his raw power burns you from the bones outward. See <em>The Price of Loss</em>.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>The Pilgrimage</h3>
                <p>You begin with <strong>1 Progress</strong>. Mark Progress when you move toward your goal (bringing the cinder to the lowest place in the world) or overcome an obstacle on your pilgrimage.</p>
                <p>At character creation, define what you believe "the lowest place in the world" is.</p>
                <p>When you reach <strong>10 Progress</strong>, you have arrived. The GM will tell you what final trial awaits.</p>
                <p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>At 3 Progress: +1 to Radiant Healing</li>
                    <li>At 6 Progress: +1 armor</li>
                    <li>At 9 Progress: Once per session, reroll a failed roll related to your pilgrimage</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you stray from the pilgrimage or abandon it, lose all Progress and take -1 ongoing until you atone.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>The Price of Loss</h3>
                <p><strong>While the lantern is missing:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lose 1 Progress at the start of each of your turns</li>
                    <li>You cannot use Radiant Healing, Holy Fire, or Turn the Darkness</li>
                    <li>Take -1 ongoing</li>
                </ul>
                <p>At 0 Progress, you only suffer the -1 ongoing. You don't die yet—but Dorvos's heat builds in your marrow.</p>
                <p><strong>If the flame is extinguished</strong>, you must rekindle it before the session ends or you die.</p>
                <p><strong>If you end a session without the lantern</strong> (lost or extinguished), you have until the end of the next session to make <em>The Sacrifice</em> or you will Involuntarily Immolate.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>The Sacrifice</h3>
                <p>When your lantern is lost or extinguished at session's end, you have until the end of the next session to complete this ritual:</p>
                <p>Choose one:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sever a limb</strong> in offering. You are permanently maimed. The GM will tell you the mechanical cost (ability penalty, reduced Load, etc.).</li>
                    <li><strong>Bind an ally or innocent to a pyre</strong> and burn them alive. They die. You are marked.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After The Sacrifice, the lantern returns (found in ash, delivered by fate) and the flame reignites. You may continue.</p>
                <p><strong>If you refuse or cannot complete The Sacrifice by the deadline</strong>, Dorvos's unfiltered presence consumes you:</p>
                <p>You <strong>Involuntarily Immolate</strong>. Your bones ignite, your flesh erupts. Deal 2d10 damage (ignores armor) to everything in close range, including allies. You die screaming. The lantern is destroyed. The pilgrimage ends.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Radiant Healing</h3>
                <p>When you <strong>hold the lantern close to a wounded ally and pray for Dorvos's mercy</strong>, roll+WIS. ✴On a 10+, restore 1d8+WIS HP and they feel warmth and hope. ✴On a 7-9, restore 1d8 HP but choose one:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The light dims; you can't use lantern moves until you rest</li>
                    <li>You take 1d4 damage channeling too much</li>
                    <li>Dorvos's silence is heavy; take -1 forward to use this move again</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Holy Fire</h3>
                <p>When you <strong>invoke the cinder's flame against enemies</strong>, describe your manifestation and roll+WIS:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Searing Burst:</strong> Near range, ignores armor, 1d8 damage</li>
                    <li><strong>Blinding Flash:</strong> Close range, enemies Defy Danger or are stunned</li>
                    <li><strong>Pillar of Flame:</strong> Near range, 1d10 damage, <em>forceful</em></li>
                </ul>
                <p>✴On a 10+, it manifests as intended. ✴On a 7-9, choose one:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The light dims until you rest</li>
                    <li>You draw unwanted attention</li>
                    <li>The flame spreads to something unintended</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Turn the Darkness</h3>
                <p>When you <strong>raise the lantern and invoke Dorvos's name against creatures of shadow, undead, or evil</strong>, roll+WIS. This does not work on mortals. ✴On a 10+, choose 3. ✴On a 7-9, choose 1:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>They flee from the light (near range)</li>
                    <li>They cannot approach while you hold the lantern high</li>
                    <li>They take 1d6 damage each moment in the light</li>
                    <li>One creature is banished or destroyed (GM's discretion based on power)</li>

                <h3>Dorvos's Wrath</h3>
                <p>When you use Holy Fire, you may <strong>spend 1 Progress</strong> to maximize its effect: deal maximum damage, affect everyone in range, or burn through any armor. The cinder flares—but you pay with distance from your goal.</p>
