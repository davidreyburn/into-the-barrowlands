            <h1>The Cave Wretch</h1>
            <p class="flavor">You're from the deep earth, from a fallen branch of humanity that never saw the sun. Gray skin, milky eyes, rodent features, your kind are little more than beasts. But you're clever. You guide surface folk through the killing dark, and when their backs are turned, you take what gleams. Gold. Steel. The things they don't appreciate. You don't belong in their world, and you never will. But you'll take what you can.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #d4b896;">Class Mechanics: Delver's Instinct</h2>
            <p><strong>You know the underground like others know their own skin.</strong> Born in lightless depths, you navigate by sound, scent, and instinct where surface-dwellers stumble blind.</p>
            <p>You can <strong>find hidden paths, squeeze through impossible gaps, and sense danger in the dark</strong> where others see only stone. Unstable ground, poisonous air, lurking predators, your senses warn you before disaster strikes.</p>
            <p><strong>In the deep earth, you are at home.</strong> You move silently, see in near-total darkness, and understand the language of stone and water. You are guide, scout, and survivor.</p>
            <p>But <strong>the surface world feels alien and hostile</strong>. Bright light blinds you. Open sky makes you anxious. The surface folk look at you with disgust and fear, and no amount of service earns their trust. You are useful, but never welcomed. You are a wretch, and you know it.</p>

                <h3>Creature of the Depths</h3>
                <p>You were born in lightless places where humanity has no claim.</p>
                <p><strong>You suffer in human society:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Take -1 to Parley with surface-dwellers who don't know you (you unsettle them)</li>
                    <li>You cannot wear most human armor or clothing without modification (your body is wrong-shaped)</li>
                    <li>Bright sunlight hurts your eyes; take -1 ongoing to any roll in direct sunlight unless you cover your face</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Underdark Guide</h3>
                <p>You know the tunnels, the caves, the forgotten ways beneath the earth. When you <strong>lead others through dangerous underground terrain</strong>, roll+WIS. ✴On a 10+, you find a safe path; the group avoids danger and makes good time. ✴On a 7-9, you find a path, but choose one:</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>You must leave something behind (supplies, gear) to proceed</li>

                <h3>Scavenger's Eye</h3>
                <p>You are obsessed with human gold and weaponry. When you see treasure or a fine weapon, the GM may compel you to take it, resist this urge by Defying Danger with WIS.</p>
                <p>When you <strong>examine treasure, weapons, or valuable goods</strong>, roll+INT. ✴On a 10+, you know its worth, origin, and any special properties. ✴On a 7-9, you know its approximate worth.</p>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Skulk and Creep</h3>
                <p>When you move quietly through shadows or underground spaces, you are nearly impossible to detect. Enemies must Discern Realities to notice you before you strike.</p>
                <p>In darkness or underground, take +1 to Defy Danger when trying to avoid detection.</p>

            <p>_____ saved me from being killed by surface-dwellers; I owe them my life.</p>
            <p>I covet something _____ owns, and I think about taking it constantly.</p>
