            <h1>The Blighted Scholar</h1>
            <p class="flavor">Something infected you. Not poison, not disease—something eldritch, wrong. It spreads through your veins, rewrites your flesh into grotesque forms. Tentacles burst from your skin when you will it. Eyes open where they shouldn't. You were a scholar once. Now you're searching for a cure while the corruption whispers promises of power. Every transformation brings you closer to the answer—or to losing yourself entirely.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #d4b896;">Class Mechanics: Corruption Track</h2>
            <p>You begin with <strong>Corruption 0</strong>. Track your Corruption from 0 to 10.</p>
            <p>As you gain power from the eldritch infection—using your grotesque transformations, calling upon forbidden knowledge, or letting the corruption spread—you mark Corruption.</p>
            <p><strong>At 10 Corruption, you lose your character to darkness.</strong> The infection consumes what remains of your humanity, and you become something else—a GM character, a horror, a lost soul.</p>
            <p>Some moves and circumstances may reduce Corruption, but the path is always easier down than up. The power is seductive, and the cure grows more distant with every transformation.</p>

            <h2>Starting Moves</h2>
            <p>You start with these moves:</p>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>The Corruption</h3>
                <p>An unknown eldritch substance courses through you, rewriting your flesh. You have Corruption marked from 0 to 10.</p>
                <p><strong>At 0 Corruption:</strong> You appear mostly normal, but veins writhe beneath your skin like something alive.</p>
                <p><strong>At 3 Corruption:</strong> Grotesque features emerge—extra eyes, grasping appendages, skin that shifts unnaturally. Your appearance unsettles others; take -1 to Parley with those who don't know you.</p>
                <p><strong>At 6 Corruption:</strong> Your form is visibly aberrant. Gain +1 to STR but -1 to CHA. Your voice echoes strangely, as if speaking from a great depth.</p>
                <p><strong>At 10 Corruption:</strong> You are no longer human. The corruption consumes you entirely. You become an NPC—a grotesque, eldritch abomination. Retire this character.</p>
                <p><strong>Mark Corruption when:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You use your eldritch abilities</li>
                    <li>You fail to resist the corruption's urges (alien hunger, compulsions to spread the substance, hearing the whispers)</li>
                    <li>You are exposed to the substance or similar eldritch corruption</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Reduce Corruption by 1 when:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You discover a clue toward the cure (rare ingredient, ancient text, etc.)</li>
                    <li>You resist the corruption's urges at great personal cost</li>
                    <li>You are treated by someone with alchemical or magical healing expertise (they must succeed at a relevant roll)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Eldritch Transformation</h3>
                <p>When you <strong>give in to the corruption and let your body change</strong>, mark 1 Corruption and choose one:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Writhing Tentacles:</strong> Tentacles burst from your body; your reach extends (close becomes reach), you can grapple multiple targets, and your unarmed attacks deal d8 damage (<em>messy</em>)</li>
                    <li><strong>Impossible Joints:</strong> Your limbs bend in unnatural ways; gain +1 to DEX and ignore difficult terrain, fit through spaces far too small for you</li>
                    <li><strong>Chitinous Growth:</strong> Hardened, shell-like growths cover your flesh; gain +1 armor</li>
                    <li><strong>Too Many Eyes:</strong> Eyes open across your skin; see in all directions and in perfect darkness, sense invisible things, but cannot close your eyes to horrors</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You may revert at will, but the changes linger in your nightmares.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Alchemical Expertise</h3>
                <p>You were a scholar before the infection. When you <strong>examine a substance, toxin, or potion</strong>, roll+INT. ✴On a 10+, you identify it perfectly—composition, effects, and how to counter it. ✴On a 7-9, you identify it but with incomplete knowledge; the GM will tell you what's missing.</p>
                <p>You can also brew simple remedies (antitoxins, poultices, stimulants) if you have the right materials.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>The Search for a Cure</h3>
                <p>At character creation, define what infected you (a relic touched, a place entered, an experiment failed, etc.).</p>
                <p>When you pursue leads related to your infection or the cure, take +1 forward. The GM will provide clues and complications along the way.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Alien Insight</h3>
                <p>The corruption grants unnatural perception. When you Discern Realities regarding:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Eldritch creatures or aberrations</li>
                    <li>Unnatural phenomena or corruption</li>
                    <li>Places touched by otherworldly forces</li>
                </ul>
                <p>...roll+WIS with +1 and add this question to the list:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What here is not of this world?</li>
                </ul>

            <p>Choose an alignment:</p>
            <p><strong>Chaotic</strong></p>
            <p>Give in to the corruption's alien urges despite knowing the consequences.</p>
            <p><strong>Neutral</strong></p>
            <p>Help someone else who is cursed, corrupted, or transforming.</p>
            <p><strong>Evil</strong></p>
            <p>Use your corruption to harm or control an innocent.</p>

            <p>I am searching for a cure, and I believe _____ can help me find it.</p>
            <p>_____ has seen me at my worst—when the corruption took over—and I fear what they think of me.</p>

            <h2>Advanced Moves</h2>
            <p>When you gain a level from 2-5, choose from these moves:</p>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Infect Others</h3>
                <p>When you <strong>touch someone and allow the corruption to spread into them</strong>, mark 1 Corruption and roll+CON. ✴On a 10+, choose 2. ✴On a 7-9, choose 1:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>They gain one benefit from Eldritch Transformation for the scene</li>
                    <li>They do not realize what you've done until later</li>
                    <li>You can sense them and their condition for the next day</li>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Aberrant Resilience</h3>
                <p>Your corrupted flesh resists harm in unnatural ways—wounds close with writhing tissue, bones bend rather than break. Gain +1 armor, but you cannot wear heavy armor (your shifting body cannot be constrained).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Scholar's Notes</h3>
                <p>You keep detailed notes on your condition and research. When you <strong>consult your notes about the infection, corruption, or eldritch phenomena</strong>, roll+INT. ✴On a 10+, ask the GM 2 questions about the topic; they answer honestly. ✴On a 7-9, ask 1 question.</p>
                <p>Useful questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What would slow this corruption?</li>
                    <li>What otherworldly force does this resemble?</li>
                    <li>Where might I find more information?</li>

            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Writhing Assault</h3>
                <p>When you <strong>unleash the corruption in a grotesque attack</strong>, mark 1 Corruption and roll+STR. ✴On a 10+, deal your damage +1d8 and horrify your target (they must Defy Danger to stand against the unnatural sight). ✴On a 7-9, deal your damage +1d8, but you cannot stop—the corruption hungers for more, and you must attack again or restrain yourself with great effort.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Alien Communion</h3>
                <p>You can sense and understand aberrations, eldritch creatures, and those touched by otherworldly forces. They recognize you as kin—something between human and the void beyond.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Studied Anatomy</h3>
                <p>When you use Eldritch Transformation, choose an additional benefit from the list without marking additional Corruption.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="menu-box">
            <h2>Advanced Moves</h2>
            <p>When you gain a level from 6-10, choose from these moves or the level 2-5 moves:</p>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Controlled Transformation</h3>
                <p>You have learned to manage the corruption. When you use Eldritch Transformation, you may choose not to mark Corruption by taking 1d6 damage instead (the strain is physical, not progressive).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Corrupted Blood</h3>
                <p>Your blood is no longer blood—it writhes with alien life. When you bleed on a weapon, it deals +1 damage and the <em>messy</em> tag for the rest of the scene. When your blood touches an enemy, they must Defy Danger or become infected (-1 ongoing for the scene as the corruption spreads through them).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Share the Burden</h3>
                <p>When you <strong>transfer some of your corruption into a willing ally</strong>, roll+Bond with them. ✴On a 10+, reduce your Corruption by 2; they gain a temporary eldritch benefit (your choice from Eldritch Transformation) without negative effects. ✴On a 7-9, reduce your Corruption by 1; they gain the benefit but also mark 1 Corruption themselves.</p>
                <p>This requires blood, touch, and trust.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>The Corruption Unleashed</h3>
                <p>Once per session, you may fully surrender to the corruption without marking Corruption. For the rest of the scene:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your damage becomes d10</li>
                    <li>Gain +2 to STR and DEX</li>
                    <li>You act on alien impulses; the GM will tell you what the corruption wants</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When the scene ends, roll+WIS. ✴On a 10+, you regain control, shaken but yourself. ✴On a 7-9, you regain control, but mark 1 Corruption from what you've done. ✴On a 6-, you remain in the corruption's grip until someone you trust brings you back.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Grotesque Apotheosis</h3>
                <p>When you <strong>transform fully into an aberrant form</strong> (mass of tentacles, impossible angles, chitinous horror, etc.), mark 2 Corruption and roll+WIS. ✴On a 10+, you retain your mind; control the form for one scene. ✴On a 7-9, you retain most of your mind, but the GM will give you one alien compulsion you must satisfy.</p>
                <p>You gain horrifying abilities: multiple limbs, unnatural strength, terrible senses, weapons that should not exist. When you revert, you are exhausted and changed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>The Cure</h3>
                <p>You've found it. Describe what it is, what it cost to obtain, and what you must do to administer it. When you use the cure, reduce your Corruption to 0. You may never mark Corruption again—but you also lose access to Eldritch Transformation and corruption-based moves.</p>
                <p>You are human again. Decide if that's enough.</p>
                <p><em>Walking the edge between humanity and the grotesque. Every transformation brings you closer to the cure—or to becoming something utterly wrong.</em></p>
