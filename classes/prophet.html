            <h1>The Prophet</h1>
            <p class="flavor">Marko, old world god, was decapitated long ago. His mummified head still speaks, to you. Through visions, it shows futures drenched in death and decay. You carry the head and perform the rituals, speaking prophecies no one wants to hear. The dead listen. The living fear. Marko shows you ruin, and you walk toward it anyway.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #d4b896;">Class Mechanics: Marko's Head</h2>
            <p>You carry <strong>Marko's mummified head</strong>, the severed remnant of an old world god. Through it, you receive visions of futures drenched in death and decay. The head grants prophecies, but at a cost.</p>
            <p><strong>The more you consult Marko, the more he demands.</strong> His influence grows with each vision. What begins as guidance becomes compulsion. The line between his will and yours blurs.</p>
            <p>The dead listen to Marko's voice when you speak his prophecies. The living fear it. The head shows you ruin, doom, and endings, but knowledge of fate does not always mean the power to change it.</p>
            <p>Your relationship with the head shapes your character. Are you his prophet, his vessel, or his prisoner? Every vision brings you closer to the answer.</p>

            <h2>Starting Moves</h2>
            <p>You start with these moves:</p>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Marko's Head</h3>
                <p>You carry the mummified head of Marko, an ancient god long dead. It speaks only to you, revealing visions of futures yet to come, always grim, always true.</p>
                <p>The head is bound to you (1 weight). It cannot be permanently lost, it will return by fate's design.</p>
                <p>When you <strong>consult Marko's head about what is to come</strong>, roll+WIS. ✴On a 10+, Marko shows you a clear vision of a coming danger or opportunity; take +1 forward when acting on this knowledge. ✴On a 7-9, the vision is fragmented or disturbing; you learn something useful but also something you wish you hadn't.</p>
                <p>The visions are always of death, decay, or doom: Marko sees only the dark paths.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Divine Conduit</h3>
                <p>You channel the will of a dead god. When you <strong>beseech Marko for divine intervention in a moment of need</strong>, describe what you ask and roll+WIS. ✴On a 10+, Marko grants your request; the miracle manifests. ✴On a 7-9, he grants it, but choose one:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It comes with a grim cost or omen</li>
                    <li>You owe him, he will demand something later</li>
                    <li>The effect is partial or temporary</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You may use this once per session without cost. Additional uses require a sacrifice (burn incense, offer blood, speak prophecy).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Prophet's Burden</h3>
                <p>You see too much. When you witness death, violence, or decay, you do not flinch, you have seen it all before in visions.</p>
                <p>Take +1 to Defy Danger against fear or horror. However, you struggle to feel hope or joy; take -1 to Parley when trying to inspire or uplift others.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Marko Effigy</h3>
                <p>You bear a Marko effigy, a carved icon, one of the only remaining images of the god (0 weight). When you display it openly:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Worshippers of old gods recognize and respect (or fear) you</li>
                    <li>You can identify places where Marko was once worshipped</li>
                    <li>Undead and spirits of the dead can sense the god's presence and may react (with reverence or hostility)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Incense Rituals</h3>
                <p>You carry an incense bag filled with sacred herbs (3 uses, 0 weight). When you <strong>burn incense and perform a ritual</strong> (10 minutes), choose one:</p>

                    <li><strong>Commune with the Dead:</strong> Ask one question of a corpse or spirit; they must answer truthfully</li>
                    <li><strong>Ward Against Decay:</strong> Preserve a body or object from rot for one week</li>
                    <li><strong>Cleanse:</strong> Remove a minor curse, disease, or corruption from yourself or another</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Replenish by gathering rare herbs or purchasing from those who remember the old ways.</p>

            <p><strong>Evil</strong></p>
            <p>Use your prophecies to manipulate someone into a doomed course of action.</p>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Death's Herald</h3>
                <p>Your prophecies become self-fulfilling. When you <strong>speak aloud a vision of someone's death</strong>, roll+WIS. ✴On a 10+, it will come to pass unless they take drastic action; they know this to be true. ✴On a 7-9, it might come to pass; they are unsettled but not certain.</p>
                <p>Once spoken, you cannot take it back.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Through Marko's Eyes</h3>
                <p>You can see through Marko's head when it is separated from you (up to one mile away). Place it somewhere and gain perfect knowledge of what happens near it, as long as you meditate.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Visions of Ruin</h3>
                <p>When you <strong>study a structure, object, or body</strong>, Marko shows you how it will fall, break, or die. Take +1 to Discern Realities regarding:</p>

                <h3>Grim Counsel</h3>
                <p>When you <strong>offer prophecy or advice drawn from Marko's visions</strong>, roll+WIS. ✴On a 10+, they believe you; take +1 ongoing when acting together on the prophecy. ✴On a 7-9, they are skeptical but wary; you gain no mechanical benefit but plant doubt.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Deathless Servant</h3>
                <p>Marko grants you the ability to raise one corpse as a loyal servant (use hireling rules: Loyalty 2, one skill related to their former life). They are lifeless and silent but obey you.</p>
                <p>If destroyed, you must perform an incense ritual and consult Marko to raise another.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Marko's Blessing</h3>
                <p>Once per session, you may speak a prophecy of survival instead of doom. When you do, choose an ally:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>They gain +1 ongoing for the rest of the session</li>
                    <li>The first time they would die, they survive with 1 HP instead</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This is exhausting; you take -1 ongoing until you rest.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Avatar of Decay</h3>

                    <li>Rot all food and water in the area (near range)</li>
                    <li>Cause a structure to decay rapidly (wood splinters, stone cracks)</li>

                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Hear the Unspoken Dead</h3>
                <p>You can hear the whispers of all dead things around you, bodies, ghosts, bones. This grants you knowledge but is maddening. When you enter a place of death (battlefield, graveyard, tomb), the GM will tell you one secret the dead know.</p>
                <p>However, their voices are always present. Take -1 to any roll requiring concentration unless you silence them with incense.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Prophet's Mantle</h3>

                    <li>The dead/undead: They acknowledge your authority; intelligent undead must Defy Danger to attack you</li>
                    <li>The skeptical: They see you as a madman; take -1 to Parley</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Last Vision</h3>
                <p>When you <strong>take your Last Breath</strong>, before you roll, Marko shows you one final vision:</p>
                <p>Ask the GM one question about the future (after your death). They will answer truthfully. Then roll your Last Breath.</p>
                <p>If you survive, you remember the vision, and it will come to pass.</p>

            <div class="move">
