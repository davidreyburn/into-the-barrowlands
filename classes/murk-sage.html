            <h1>The Murk Sage</h1>
            <p class="flavor">You were born where light dies. The shadows taught you their language, how to bend them, speak through them, show others what hides in the dark corners of their minds. In sunlight you're fragile, half-blind. But when darkness falls, you are sovereign. The nightmares you weave are real enough to kill, and the shadows never forget a friend.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #d4b896;">Class Mechanics: Shadow Weaving</h2>
            <p>You <strong>shape darkness itself</strong>. Shadows are not merely the absence of light to you, they are substance, tool, ally, and weapon.</p>
            <p><strong>In darkness, you thrive.</strong> Create nightmares that manifest as tangible horrors, cloak allies in shadow to hide them from sight, step between dark places as if they were doorways. The shadows obey your will.</p>
            <p><strong>In light, you suffer.</strong> Direct sunlight weakens you, and your magic fades when exposed to bright illumination. You are fragile where others are strong, powerful where others are blind.</p>
            <p>But there is a deeper cost: <strong>the more you dwell in shadow, the less you remember the light.</strong> Your connection to the world of the living grows distant. Warmth, hope, joy, these become foreign concepts. The shadows are loyal, but they are also hungry.</p>

            <h2>Starting Moves</h2>
            <p>You start with these moves:</p>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Shadowcraft</h3>
                <p>When you <strong>weave illusions from living shadow in darkness (dim light or worse)</strong>, describe what you create and roll+WIS. ✴On a 10+, the illusion is vivid and believable; choose 2. ✴On a 7-9, it manifests but is flawed; choose 1:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It moves and reacts as you will it</li>
                    <li>It produces convincing sound</li>
                    <li>It can be touched without revealing itself</li>
                    <li>It lasts until you dismiss it or leave the area</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In bright light, you cannot use this move.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Nightmare Projection</h3>
                <p>When you <strong>gaze into someone's eyes and dredge up their fears</strong>, roll+WIS. ✴On a 10+, you learn their deepest fear and can manifest a shadowy vision of it; they must Defy Danger (WIS) or freeze/flee. ✴On a 7-9, you glimpse a fear and create a weak echo; they are unsettled but not paralyzed.</p>
                <p>Requires at least dim lighting.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Eyes Adapt</h3>
                <p>You see perfectly in darkness. Mundane shadows never hinder you, and you can navigate lightless places as if they were lit.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Darkness Lingers</h3>
                <p>Even in bright light, small shadows persist, behind the eyes, beneath the tongue, in the heart.</p>
                <p>When you have no other darkness, you may draw upon these inner shadows to use Shadowcraft at -1 ongoing. This is exhausting; the GM will tell you when you've pushed too far.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="menu-box">

            <p><strong>Neutral</strong></p>
            <p>Reveal a hidden truth by showing someone their fear or desire.</p>
            <p><strong>Evil</strong></p>
            <p>Use darkness to harm an innocent or exploit their terror.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="menu-box-light">
            <h2>Bonds</h2>
            <p>Fill in the name of one of your companions in at least one:</p>
            <p>_____ does not fear the dark, and that intrigues me.</p>
            <p>I have shown _____ a nightmare they cannot forget.</p>
            <p>_____ trusts me despite the shadows I command.</p>
            <p>I owe _____ a debt; they pulled me from the darkness when I was lost.</p>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Birth Terrors</h3>

                <p>When you <strong>snuff out a light source with a gesture</strong>, roll+WIS. ✴On a 10+, the light is gone and darkness spreads. ✴On a 7-9, the light flickers and dies, but something notices.</p>

                <h3>Sage's Thought</h3>
                <p><em>Requires: Sage Thought talisman</em></p>
                <p>Your skull talisman now houses an illusion tied to your mind. It can act independently within sight range, scout, and relay what it perceives. If destroyed, you cannot use Shadowcraft until you carve a new one (requires a day's work and a fresh skull).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">

                <p><em>Requires: Moon Marker</em></p>
                <p>You track the sun's position even in darkness or underground. You always know when night falls, how long until dawn, and whether you are in true darkness or merely dim light. When your Moon Marker is broken, you lose this sense until you repair it under a full moon.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Master of Shadows</h3>
                <p>Your Shadowcraft illusions are now indistinguishable from reality. On a 10+, they are perfect, even touch and taste are convincing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="move">
                <h3>Living Nightmare</h3>
                <p>When you use Nightmare Projection on a 10+, you may choose to make the nightmare linger. It will haunt them for days, appearing in their dreams and at the edge of their vision. They take -1 ongoing until they confront and overcome the fear you've shown them.</p>
                <p><em>In darkness, you are unmatched. In light, you are fragile, but the shadows behind every eye offer refuge.</em></p>
